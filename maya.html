    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
       The Maya Empire,
 centered in the tropical lowlands of what is now Guatemala,
 reached the peak of its power and influence around the sixth century A.D.
 The Maya excelled at agriculture, pottery,
 hieroglyph writing, calendar-making and mathematics,
 and left behind an astonishing amount of impressive architecture and
 symbolic artwork. Most of the great stone cities of the Maya were abandoned
 by A.D. 900, however, and since the 19th century scholars have debated what
 might have caused this dramatic decline
