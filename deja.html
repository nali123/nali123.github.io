What if we die and the light of the end of the tunnel is the light 
to another hospital room, there we were born and the only reason you cry
is because you remember everything from your past life and you're crying at the
fact that you died and lost everything, as you grow you started to forget your 
past life and focus on the life you have now, but patches of memory stay behind
and the memory causes deja vu. Think about that for a sec.

<h2>Directions</h2>
