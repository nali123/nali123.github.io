    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The Aztecs appeared in Mesoamerica–as the south-central
 region of pre-Columbian Mexico is known–in the early 13th century.
 Their arrival came just after, or perhaps helped bring about,
 the fall of the previously dominant Mesoamerican civilization, the Toltecs.
